I used Selenium with Java to write this script for the UI automation test.
To keep it simple and  bacuse of the size of the test, I did not use frameworks like testNG or page object model.
Selenium  is a preferred tool for me as it has a wide range of community support. it is rubost and allows for integration with other automation tool. It is also very languauge flexible


FOR THE SCENARIO ABOUT RETRIEVING CODE FROM THE EMAIL
Use a library or tool (JavaMail API or another email testing library) to access the email inbox where the confirmation code is sent. If the application sends emails to a real inbox, 
you may use an email testing service or a dedicated email library to retrieve the confirmation code. 
YOu could also navigate to the email, login and retrieve the confimation code
